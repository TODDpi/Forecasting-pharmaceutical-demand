# Forecasting-pharmaceutical-demand
My undergrad thesis course. Doing under the supervision of Dr. Sultana Parvin. I am using NEAT (Neuro-evolutionary augmenting topologies) to find the best neural network architecture. Then I will compare it with standard times series forecasting models like ARIMA, ML, Deep and shallow neural networks.
